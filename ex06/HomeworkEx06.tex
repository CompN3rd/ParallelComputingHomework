\section{Task 1}
What could be a problem by distributing an equal number of rows to each processor? \\

In case of a big sparse matrix it is not a good idea, because every processor should calculate the same number of operations and with some matrices the number of non-zero elements is not equally distributed by each row. 
A better approuch is to send the same number of non-zero matrix elements. This would lead to a more complex implementation and more overhead from sending and receiving.
